# scancreator

This is a more advanced script batch building Gaussian input files for scans from last point of logfiles. 
It creates two inputs - one for each bridge. It is specifically designed to work with data from Schiff bases project, but can be modified to work with other files - but it's better to use GaussianMaster package.
